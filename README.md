###  about me 

-  co-founder & cto @ [airstitch](https://airstitch.ai) — text what you need, it happens. works on whatsapp + dashboard.
-  i write a lot of `python`, `typescript`, `go`, and ship before it's perfect
-  born in mumbai, building from SF / VA / wherever there's wifi
-  obsessed with: **text-native interfaces**, **systems that just work**, **shipping fast**
-  when not coding, I'm hiking, watching cricket, or pretending to play ukulele
